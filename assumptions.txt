Assumptions
- for simplicity only integer numbers are considered
- computation is evaluated for all occurrences of "apply" instruction whenever it is found in the file
	- provides more flexibility in expression of different computations
	- from the specification it is not clear whether multiple occurrences (or none) of the "apply" instruction shall be considered as faulty input or not or if the first occurrence of "apply" instruction shall terminate the evaluation of additional instructions
- all instruction are for simplicity converted to upper case
